#Products
At Zum Rails one product can have one or more prices, these are called product prices and need to be informed at the moment of creating a product. Product prices can have different types of configurations such as Pricing Model and Frequency.

**Pricing Models Types**

Type | Behavior 
--------- | ------- 
Standard | You should select standard pricing if you want to charge your users a fixed price per unit.
Package | You should select package pricing if you want to charge your users for a group of units. Say you charge $50 for every 10 units. If the user buys 15 units, he will be charged $100 by default.

**Frequency Types**

Type | Behavior 
--------- | ------- 
OneTime | If this is a product which is available as a one time purchase by paying the full price right now, choose frequency “OneTime”.
Recurring | If this is a product which is available as a recurring subscription, choose frequency “Recurring".
