`Endpoint: {{env}}/api/authorize`

All API requests are using the Bearer Token Authorization. A Bearer Token will last up to an hour from the time it is generated, allowing multiple API calls to be made securely without authorizing each time.

To be able to get your token access, open the Settings page in the Portal, then navigate to the section API settings. You will need the username and password.

**Input parameters**
