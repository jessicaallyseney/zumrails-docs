  How to integrate with aggregation API
---
When aggregation is enabled in your account, Zūm Rails can pull a user’s financial data. This applies for use-cases such as account verification (Know Your Customer - KYC) and risk assessment (90 days of transaction history).

To pull a user’s financial data, this user will have to login using Zūm Connect. If a user was registered with Zūm Rails through a method outside of Zūm Connect, his financial data cannot be extracted.

Zūm will then dispatch the connection to the financial data aggregator.

Code Block for Get a user's bank account information

When a user logs in through the Zūm Connect iframe, his information can be accessed by calling the user/getBankaccountinformation endpoint.

:::caution
This endpoint will only work for users who have successfully connected through the financial aggregator integrated with Zūm Rails.
