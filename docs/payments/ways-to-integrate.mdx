  Ways to integrate

There are various ways to integrate with Zūm Rails. Check the options below to decide what fits your workflow:

**Full api integration**: You can start using our API endpoints (check API documentation [here](../api-specification/api-introduction)) to create transactions, add users, create invoices, etc.
 With the API integration you have full control over the UI that your end user will see and you can develop it based on your business use cases. 
 This is one of the most secure ways of integrating since all API requests are using the Bearer Token Authorization. 
 A Bearer Token will last up to an hour from the time it is generated, allowing multiple API calls to be made securely without authorizing each time. 
 Understand more about the Authorize endpoint [here](../api-specification/authentication). 

**Portal**: You can use the portal to create transactions, add users, create invoices, etc. 
You can view our FAQs and also check out our video tutorials to learn more about how to start moving money using the portal. 
If you prefer to use the portal, you will not have to do any API integration and you can start right away through the portal.

**Hybrid (recommended)**: We recommend using a mix of both APIs and the portal as it is more robust and secure to use the APIs and you can view the details of your transactions, keep track of the money being moved, download reports, etc. by leveraging 
the functionalities available in the Zūm portal. You can use the API/SDK or host our URL within your application to add users, create transactions, send payment links to your users, etc and receive real time updates on the status of users and transactions so you can automate your next call to action depending on the status of the payments. 


# Zūm Connect

## Using URL

Our URLs allow you to host our UI within your application and it's the easiest to use for our clients.  It's a unique URL which you can host as an iframe, send by e-mail or sms. 

:::note
To get the URLs go to the embedded code section inside the settings menu on Zūm Rails Portal

## User tokenization / Add payment profile
The best way to add a user to the Zūm Rails platform is through Zūm Connect. It consists of an iFrame website, hosted by Zūm Rails and referenced in your website.

The Zūm Connect iframe will display a form to capture the user's basic information (Full Name and Email) so that we can create an identity.
 
The user will always be asked to agree and consent the information shared (PAD). The message can be customized for your needs as well.
Your specific settings will be available under your profile in Zūm Rails portal. Depending on your need, you can capture the new user using our webhook mechanism, or if you need it right at the moment we redirect back to your flow, you can capture the Zūm user id (token) by listening to an event message as described in your portal settings.

After a user creates and links his account, you will be able to view it in the Zūm Rails portal or use the API to filter and get a specific user.

`{{env}}/connect/{{customerId}}?allowEft=true&language=fr`

`{{env}}/connect/{{customerId}}?allowEft=true&allowInterac=true`

### Event Listeners

When a new user is added or a request funds is fulfilled, Zūm Connect will trigger an event to provide to your application the UserId, TransactionId or RecurrentTransactionId.

To listen to the event in js, your website must refer to Zūm Connect using an iFrame, and then your website should have the script/example.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Javascript example', value: 'tab1'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```html
  <script>
  window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
      
      var data = e.data;
      if (data && data.origin && data.origin === 'ZUM_RAILS') {
          console.log(data);
      }
  });
  </script>
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Add user event', value: 'tab1'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```json
  {
    "origin": "ZUM_RAILS",
    "userId": "c18dd952-...-9bd6a46eb1c4"
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Invoice checkout
The best way to let the user choose and pay for an item is using the checkout. It consists of an iFrame website, hosted by Zūm Rails and referenced in your website.
The Iframe will display the products/prices to the user and they can choose what they would like to pay for. It will display the form to collect the user’s payment information, then create a transaction and send the invoice to the user over their email once the transaction is successful.

### Event Listener
When a new invoice is created through checkout, Zūm Connect will trigger an event to provide to your application the UserId, TransactionId or InvoiceId.

To listen to the js event, your website must refer to Zūm Connect using an iFrame, and then your website should have the script/example as described.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="rails"
  values={[
    {label: 'Other Rails', value: 'rails'},
    {label: 'EFT', value: 'eft'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="rails">

  ```json
  {
    "origin": "ZUM_RAILS",
    "invoiceId": "c18dd952-...-9bd6a46eb1c4",
    "userId": "c18dd952-...-9bd6a46eb1c4",
    "transactionId": "c18dd952-...-9bd6a46eb1c4"
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="eft">

  ```json
  {
    "origin": "ZUM_RAILS",
    "userId": "c18dd952-...-9bd6a46eb1c4",
  }
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Subscription checkout
The best way to let the user choose and subscribe to an item is using the checkout. It consists of an iFrame website, hosted by Zūm Rails and referenced in your website.
The Iframe will display the products/prices to the user and they can choose what they would like to subscribe to. It will display the form to collect the user’s payment information, create the subscription and email the subscription details to the user.

:::note
In case of subscription, a new invoice will be generated based on the billing cycle. Whenever a new invoice is generated we will automatically charge the payment method that was used when creating the subscription using the checkout link.
