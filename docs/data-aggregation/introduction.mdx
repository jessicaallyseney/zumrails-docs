# Introduction

Welcome to Zūm Rails Aggregation Documentation!

This documentation provides both a high-level view of the process as well as the steps to successfully use the aggregation services.
## Ways to integrate

There are two main ways of using Zūm Rails Aggregation service:

### Full API Integration

This allows your application to take full control of the experience, it's recommended only for partners. In order to have access to it, please drop us a message at [support@zumrails.com](mailto:support@zumrails.com). 

### Connector UI

This allows you to display Zūm Rails Aggregation inside your current flow, it's the recommended way for most of our clients.

There are two different ways to use Connector UI, using a javascript library to initiate it, or simply getting a public URL. 

- **[The Connector SDK](./connector-sdk)**, gives you more security and flexibility to take actions based on javascript callbacks.

- **[The Connector UI](./connector-ui)** it's the easiest way to use. It's a unique URL you can host as an iframe, send by e-mail or sms.

## Configure

```html
<iframe 
    src="https://connector.aggregation.zumrails.com/connector-setup" 
    title="Setup"
    scrolling="no"
    style="border:0px; width:100%; height: 652px; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
```
