# Introduction

Welcome to ZÅ«m Rails Connect SDK Documentation!

This documentation provides both a high-level view of the process as well as the steps to successfully use the connect services.

### Connect SDK

**Connect SDK is the recommended way of integrating with Zum Rails Connect** for most of our clients. For this integration method, we provide you a complete component for you to embed inside your existing application.

Using a javascript library (The Connect SDK) to initiate it, gives you more security and flexibility to take actions based on javascript callbacks.

The first step to build your connect sdk integration is to [configure](./configure) your experience.
